    <p>I’ve recently received a conditional offer to read mathematics at Balliol College. There are a lot of things I wish I knew sooner and as such I’m gonna share it here.</p>

<h2 id="knowing-more">Knowing more</h2>

<p>Beside the official information that you could easily find, there’s a couple resources that I’ve found to be immensely helpful. The most important of all would probably be the archived course materials (<a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/year/2019-2020">2019-2020</a>). It contains every course and their respective materials for some particular academic year. It’s comforting to know what learning mathematics at Oxford would really be like. The lecture notes you would read, the problem sheets you would do etc</p>

<p>The above is critical in making sure you pick the right course! Don’t pick “Maths and Computer Science” just because you’re interested in both mathematics and computer science! Make sure you know exactly what you’re sacrificing and what you’re gaining with every course option you can take.</p>

<p>Other than that, you could also read the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/undergraduate-courses/teaching-and-learning/handbooks-synopses">UG mathematics handbooks</a> to have a detailed overview of the course itself.</p>

<p>For the choice of colleges, you could look at admit rates, teaching faculties, Norrington tables etc. You could refer to a <a href="https://etherlin.top/2021-04-10/How-do-you-choose-your-Oxford-College">short article</a> my friend has written on the topic. As tutors would be responsible for teaching you in tutorials, it would be beneficial to find colleges with tutors that somewhat align with your interested fields. However, if you wish to go to a college purely because of a single faculty member there, then you might run the risk that that faculty member moves.</p>

<h2 id="the-admission-process">The Admission Process</h2>

<p>To get admitted, you have to understand why the admission process exists in the first place. Step into the shoes of the tutors who designed the whole process. They are trying to decide on one thing - whether they want to teach (or at least, put up with) you for the next four years. This question is especially important for applying to Oxford as the teaching here is very personal. As such, you need to convince them that they <em>do</em> want to teach you! Now how do you do that?</p>

<p>Firstly, you show that you’re capable in mathematics, so that the tutors at least have some place to start and wouldn’t cry marking your problem sheets.</p>

<p>Secondly, you show that you’re interested in mathematics. Imagine being a tutor enthusiastically talking about their favourite bits of mathematics, only to find students waiting for the class to end!</p>

<p>Thirdly, you show that you are committed to mathematics. Not everyone could withstand studying mathematics all the time for four years. You have to show them that you’re ready for such a committent and wouldn’t give up half way. Frustrating it would be to teach someone who’s given up!</p>

<p>Finally, you show that you could be changed for the better, so that when the tutors try to correct your thinking / behaviour, they wouldn’t be talking to a wall. (If you can’t improve from their teaching, everyone’s just wasting their time!)</p>

<p>Everything in the admission process is about testing one or more of those four aspects mentioned above. The personal statement demonstrates your interest and committent, the admission test demonstrates your technical ability and the interview demonstrates whether you could be taught.</p>

<h2 id="mathematics-admission-test">Mathematics Admission Test</h2>

<h3 id="do-past-papers">Do past papers</h3>

<p>Doing all the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=Mathematics+Applitude+Test">past papers</a> is perhaps the best way to prepare. You should do some of them under timed conditions. However, doing some questions is always better than doing none at all, so don’t force yourself to do every paper under timed conditions if you don’t have the time for it. You should also check out the official <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test/mat-livestream">MAT livestream</a>. If you really want to do more exercise, do the <a href="https://maths.org/step/assignments">STEP foundation modules</a>. They are really fun and teaches skills and ideas mostly relevant to MAT.</p>

<h3 id="use-the-previous-subparts">Use the previous subparts</h3>

<p>All the subparts of the question should be logically connected. If you get stuck, try to use the results you got from the previous subparts.</p>

<p>Even if you are sure something would work yet it doesn’t use the previous subparts, you should still try to think of an alternative solution that uses them. It would usually be more elegant and less time-consuming.</p>

<h3 id="be-thorough">Be thorough</h3>

<p>Every keyword / condition that appears in the question should be mentioned / copied at least once on your answer. You should also  clearly state the results you’ve proved in the previous parts, and why they are applicable to your situation.</p>

<p>Doing so helps you realise whether you have used all of the information given, and lets the marker know that you are rigorously answering the question.</p>

<p>Some questions (Usually Q5) have a lot of cases to consider. You need to be very careful about them as there are often exceptional cases.</p>

<h3 id="intuition">Intuition</h3>

<p>While there are exceptions, most questions could usually be answered without much steps. If you find yourself painfully expanding terms, you are probably not noticing something you should’ve. This is especially important in graph questions. Usually you need to spot some rigid transformation.</p>

<h2 id="interviews">Interviews</h2>

<h3 id="recite-common-identities-beforehand">Recite common identities beforehand</h3>

<p>Try to recite some of the common identities (calculus, trigonometry …)  before the interview. It would be unfortunate if you had to waste valuable time deducing them on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="take-your-time">Take your time</h3>

<p>Since you would be stressed out during the interview, it’s very easy to commit careless mistakes (copying wrongly, arithmetic errors …). Taking your time is better than reaching the wrong conclusion and having to backtrack. Be through and write down or speak out everything.</p>

<h3 id="communicating-with-the-tutors">Communicating with the tutors</h3>

<p>Talk out loud. This is a very common advice and has to be stressed.</p>

<p>Other than that, you should try and describe what your next steps are. This is especially true if you think you’ve figured out the solution. If you explain yourself, the tutors would not have to worry about whether you’re on the right track while they are watching you work.</p>

<p>This is especially important if you are unsure whether you’re on the right track. If you explain yourself, they would usually say something to indicate whether you’re on the right track. If they affirm your plan, then great! You don’t have to worry about having the wrong approach when you’re elaborating the solution. If they dispute it, then at least you didn’t waste time further explaining it.</p>

<p>The tutors may also be more lenient on your careless mistakes since they know that you have the right thought in mind. If you didn’t talk about your plans, they may think that you have had the entirely wrong idea from the first place.</p>

<p>If you caught a mistake you have just committed, be calm! Say to the tutors that you have made a mistake, explain why it’s wrong, and slowly correct it. Ultimately, doing so shows that you are capable of identifying mistakes and correcting them logically. Never haphazardly correct it only to find out that it’s wrong again, it would give an impression that you are not logical and through enough.</p>

<h3 id="ask-questions-if-necessary">Ask questions if necessary</h3>

<p>Usually the tutors will ensure that you know the background and the context of the question. However if they throw out a word or a phrase that they expect you to understand yet you don’t, it’s perfectly fine to ask them about it.</p>

<p>However, if you have heard of a similar term, you should perhaps verbally guess what the term may mean in addition to asking about it, or state clearly what you are confused about. You would be able to show your thought process (which is ultimately what your tutors want to evaluate in the interview) and the tutors would be able to give you a better answer.</p>

<h3 id="predict-what-they-would-ask-you">Predict what they would ask you</h3>

<p>Their first question they ask you might be very easy. While you are answering it, think about the complications they could throw at you. If they were asking about the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n = 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span> case, what about <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>3...</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n = 2, 3 ...</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8388800000000001em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord">3...</span></span></span></span>? Could you figure out a general solution? Don’t rely on brute force methods for simple questions. Usually they won’t work for larger cases or the tutors would just ask you to generalize the solution.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-the-tutors-say-youre-wrong">What if the tutors say you’re wrong?</h3>

<p>Firstly, don’t get defensive. Keep your cool.</p>

<p>Secondly, look out for any careless mistakes. If you spot some, take your time to explain and correct them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, think about whether there was any miscommunication. Sometimes the tutors might have lost your train of thought. If you are certain that you are right, change the angle of your approach slightly (to show that you’re not entirely stubborn) and explain yourself in detail again.</p>

<p>If they still imply that you are wrong, it’s very important to be flexible. Don’t be fixated at the method that you’ve been using. Listen to them carefully and give a meaningful response that reflects your understanding of what they’ve said. The response doesn’t necessarily have to show that you have solved the problem, it could just be you explaining why you were wrong. Then recall what questions they have asked you. Similar to the MAT, all the subparts of the question are somewhat connected. Try to figure out some deeper connection between them.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-final-touch">As a final touch</h2>

<p>Don’t let university application get into your head too much! Ultimately, mathematics should be the thing that you pursue the most. Don’t let your interest into mathematics die out or all would be pointless!</p>
