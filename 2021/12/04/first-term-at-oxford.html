    <p>Having been through the hectic Michaelmas term at Oxford, here are some general thoughts about it.</p>

<h2 id="work-work-work">Work, work, work</h2>

<p>I consistently spent around 40 hours per week working on my tablet, which was surprisingly similar to the figure of “working time” recommended in the handbook given to mathematics undergraduates. I never thought it was possible for me to spend this much time on work, yet when you get here and everyone is doing the same thing, it felt almost natural.</p>

<p>I suppose it goes to show how important a tablet is (If you don’t have one, get one!). It’s just so much easier editing, revising or organising everything on a tablet compared to using pen and paper.</p>

<h2 id="consistency">Consistency</h2>

<p>Since the intensity of the work lasts for 8 weeks, the consistency of work really matters. Burning midnight fuel on any week that is not the last would not be worthwhile.</p>

<p>You should also be consistent in aspects other than work. Even though taking a day <em>completely</em> off is rather impossible, you could still make someday of the week (say the day after the weekly deadlines) to be <em>relatively</em> relaxing. Or you could organise a weekly hangout with friends. It really helps a lot to have some sort of weekly routine going on.</p>

<p>Using something like screen time to record the time you spend working is also great at helping you maintain consistency. It reminds you to take breaks if you have been overworking and to work more if you’re falling behind schedule. It eliminates self-doubt about whether you’re working hard enough.</p>

<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>

<p>Not only do you need to get work done, but you also need to get it done fast. Mostly this means minimizing the time you get “stuck” on something. It helps a lot to consider a flowchart whenever you get stuck. Have you missed something in the lecture notes? Have you tried watching the lectures first? Have you tried asking other people about it? Could you ask about it in an upcoming tutorial? The less time you spend being unproductive, the more time you have to work (and rest).</p>

<h2 id="attitude">Attitude</h2>

<p>It is important to stay interested in what you’re working on. On multiple occasions, I was tempted to treat work mechanically and simply “get through it”, yet that would ultimately ruin my interest in mathematics, rendering the whole venture of studying mathematics pointless.</p>

<h2 id="time-management">Time management</h2>

<p>Being aware of the number of hours you have per day is tremendously useful. To have 6 hours of productive work would probably end up taking 9-10 hours. Since you also need 8 hours of sleep and 2 hours on eating your meals / maintaining yourself, you end up with around 6 hours of free time, which really isn’t a lot if you decide to attend any social / sports / extra-curricular event. If you really need to take a break off the weekends, then the arithmetic gets even harsher.</p>

<p>While it may pain you to realise this, you really cannot do everything you want to do especially during the first term of the first year. I would recommend putting off non-urgent activities or societies for later terms or years.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There’s of course a lot more nuances to student life here, but since there’s always so much going on in Oxford, it’s more important to keep the big picture in mind.</p>
