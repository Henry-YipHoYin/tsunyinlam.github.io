Hello! I'm Toby Lam, a secondary school student from Hong Kong. I'm mainly intersted in linear and abstract algebra. I also do some physics and computer science.

This website is intended to be a blog and a personal website at the same time. You could check out my posts [here](https://greenone092.github.io/).

Here's my [CV]({{ site.url }}/download/CV.pdf) as at August 2020. 

You can contact me by sending an email to greenone092@gmail.com
