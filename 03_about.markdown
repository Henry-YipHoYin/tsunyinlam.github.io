Hello! I'm Toby Lam, a secondary school student from Hong Kong. I'm mainly intersted in linear and abstract algebra. I also do some physics and computer science.

This website is intended to be a blog and a personal website at the same time. Due to my young age, I view the blog as a channel for me to explore mathematical exposition, as such I apologise should the quality be not up to standard.

Here's my [CV]({{ site.url }}/download/CV.pdf) as at August 2020. 

You can contact me by sending an email to greenone092@gmail.com
