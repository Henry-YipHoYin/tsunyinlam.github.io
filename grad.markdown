*"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment."* - Buddha

SJC has truly been a wonderful experience. The exceptional freedom and trust granted to students and the sheer diversity of the school's reach in extra curricular activities have given me so much room to explore my interests.

I would especially like to thank past and current members, committees and teacher-in-charage for mathematics society. Without alumni who frequent our stalls in Open Days or give talks to voracious students, without past and curent committee members who make time to contribute despite a hustling scheudule, there would have never been a bustling community of mathematicians in SJC, which continues to go strong today. 

If for any reason you would like to contact me, feel free to find my information [here]({{site.url}}/about)
