## Mathematics

I'm generally interested in linear algebra and abstract algbera. 

Currently, I'm interested in probability, especially urn models.

I also have a basic understanding of cryptography, coding theory, non-euclidean geometry and differential geometry.

## Technology

I'm generally interested in typsetting documents via $$\LaTeX$$ and web development via Jekyll.

I also have a basic understanding of C++, Java, Unity and competive programming.

## Miscellaneous

I play the piano, learning Fantaisie-Impromptu at the moment.

I'm also an avid gamer, with my favourite video game being Team Fortress 2 with Fistful of Frags being a close second. I've also dumped an unhealthy amount of time into Hearthstone and RimWorld.

My favourite movie has got to be Pulp Fiction. It's insane how much memorable scenes are densely packed into its 2 and a half hours runtime. I'm also a huge fan of Wes Anderson, with Moonrise Kingdom being my favourite movie of his. 

In terms of animation, I throughoughly enjoyed Adventure Time (and the specials, Distant Lands) and Bojack Horseman. 

In terms of youtube channels. I watch Roffle's daily wild hearthstone gameplay. 3b1b's videos (especially his linear algebra series) were also momenumental for my learning in mathematics.

Speaking of books, my favourite book of all time would probably be Hemingway's A Moveable Feast. 

I also play badminton.
