There are a lot of things I wish I knew sooner and as such I’m gonna share it here. I’m gonna try to exclude some of the most talked over points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also not going to talk much about my personal statement since there is no way to know whether my tutors actually liked it or not. My only advice would be to write a statement that you are truly familiar and satisfied with! You should however ask for others’ opinions. If their ideas persuade you, then you should change it. If not, don’t! Ultimately, it’s your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowing-more&quot;&gt;Knowing more&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the official information that you could easily find, there’s a couple resources that I’ve found to be immensely helpful. The most important of all would probably be the archived course materials (&lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/year/2019-2020&quot;&gt;2019-2020&lt;/a&gt;). It contains every course and their respective materials for some particular academic year. It’s comforting to know what learning mathematics at Oxford would really be like. The lecture notes you would read, the problem sheets you would do etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, you could also read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/undergraduate-courses/teaching-and-learning/handbooks-synopses&quot;&gt;UG mathematics handbooks&lt;/a&gt; to have a detailed overview of the course itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the choice of colleges, you could look at admit rates, teaching faculties, Norrington tables etc. You could refer to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://etherlin.top/2021-04-10/How-do-you-choose-your-Oxford-College&quot;&gt;short article&lt;/a&gt; my friend has written on the topic. As tutors would be responsible for teaching you in tutorials, it would be beneficial to find colleges with tutors that somewhat align with your interested fields. However, if you wish to go to a college purely because of a single faculty member there, then you might run the risk that that faculty member moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mathematics-admission-test&quot;&gt;Mathematics Admission Test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=Mathematics+Applitude+Test&quot;&gt;past papers&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the best way to prepare. You should do some of them under timed conditions. However, doing some questions is always better than doing none at all, so don’t force yourself to do every paper under timed conditions if you don’t have the time for it. You should also check out the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test/mat-livestream&quot;&gt;MAT livestream&lt;/a&gt;. If you really want to do more exercise, do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maths.org/step/assignments&quot;&gt;STEP foundation modules&lt;/a&gt;. They are really fun and teaches skills and ideas mostly relevant to MAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;use-the-previous-subparts&quot;&gt;Use the previous subparts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the subparts of the question should be logically connected. If you get stuck, try to use the results you got from the previous subparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are sure something would work yet it doesn’t use the previous subparts, you should still try to think of an alternative solution that uses them. It would usually be more elegant and less time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;be-thorough&quot;&gt;Be thorough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every keyword / condition that appears in the question should be mentioned / copied at least once on your answer. You should also  clearly state the results you’ve proved in the previous parts, and why they are applicable to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing so helps you realise whether you have used all of the information given, and lets the marker know that you are rigorously answering the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions (Usually Q5) have a lot of cases to consider. You need to be very careful about them as there are often exceptional cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intuition&quot;&gt;Intuition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are exceptions, most questions could usually be answered without much steps. If you find yourself painfully expanding terms, you are probably not noticing something you should’ve. This is especially important in graph questions. Usually you need to spot some rigid transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interviews&quot;&gt;Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation-1&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to recite some of the common identities (calculus, trigonometry …)  before the interview. It would be unfortunate if you had to waste valuable time deducing them on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;be-thorough-1&quot;&gt;Be thorough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you would be stressed out during the interview, it’s very easy to commit careless mistakes (copying wrongly, arithmetic errors …). Taking your time is better than reaching the wrong conclusion and having to backtrack. Be through and write down or speak out everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;communicating-with-the-tutors&quot;&gt;Communicating with the tutors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk out loud. This is a very common advice and has to be stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, you should try and describe what your next steps are. This is especially true if you think you’ve figured out the solution. If you explain yourself, the tutors would not have to worry about whether you’re on the right track while they are watching you work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important if you are unsure whether you’re on the right track. If you explain yourself, they would usually say something to indicate whether you’re on the right track. If they affirm your plan, then great! You don’t have to worry about having the wrong approach when you’re elaborating the solution. If they dispute it, then at least you didn’t waste time further explaining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tutors may also be more lenient on your careless mistakes since they know that you have the right thought in mind. If you didn’t talk about your plans, they may think that you have had the entirely wrong idea from the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you caught a mistake you have just committed, be calm! Say to the tutors that you have made a mistake, explain why it’s wrong, and slowly correct it. Ultimately, doing so shows that you are capable of identifying mistakes and correcting them logically. Never haphazardly correct it only to find out that it’s wrong again, it would give an impression that you are not logical and through enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ask-questions-if-necessary&quot;&gt;Ask questions if necessary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the tutors will ensure that you know the background and the context of the question. However if they throw out a word or a phrase that they expect you to understand yet you don’t, it’s perfectly fine to ask them about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you have heard of a similar term, you should perhaps verbally guess what the term may mean in addition to asking about it, or state clearly what you are confused about. You would be able to show your thought process (which is ultimately what your tutors want to evaluate in the interview) and the tutors would be able to give you a better answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;predict-what-they-would-ask-you&quot;&gt;Predict what they would ask you&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their first question they ask you might be very easy. While you are answering it, think about the complications they could throw at you. If they were asking about the &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;n = 1&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; case, what about &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo separator=&quot;true&quot;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3...&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;n = 2, 3 ...&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.8388800000000001em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mpunct&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;3...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;? Could you figure out a general solution? Don’t rely on brute force methods for simple questions. Usually they won’t work for larger cases or the tutors would just ask you to generalize the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-if-the-tutors-say-youre-wrong&quot;&gt;What if the tutors say you’re wrong?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, don’t get defensive. Keep your cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, look out for any careless mistakes. If you spot some, take your time to explain and correct them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, think about whether there was any miscommunication. Sometimes the tutors might have lost your train of thought. If you are certain that you are right, change the angle of your approach slightly (to show that you’re not entirely stubborn) and explain yourself in detail again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they still imply that you are wrong, it’s very important to be flexible. Don’t be fixated at the method that you’ve been using. Listen to them carefully and give a meaningful response that reflects your understanding of what they’ve said. The response doesn’t necessarily have to show that you have solved the problem, it could just be you explaining why you were wrong. Then recall what questions they have asked you. Similar to the MAT, all the subparts of the question are somewhat connected. Try to figure out some deeper connection between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-a-final-touch&quot;&gt;As a final touch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let university application get into your head too much! Ultimately, mathematics should be the thing that you pursue the most. Don’t let your interest into mathematics die out or all would be pointless!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Toby Lam</name><email>greenone092@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I’ve recently received a conditional offer to read mathematics at Balliol College.

&lt;p&gt;In Zoom, the control you have over your webcam footage is limited. You can either turn your camera on or off, or add a greenscreen, and that’s about it. However through OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), you could freely customize the webcam footage shown. This freedom gives various benefits. Namely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your system does not satisfy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360043484511&quot;&gt;minimum system requirements for virtual background for zoom&lt;/a&gt;, you could use Skype’s virtual background function to process your webcam’s footage, then stream it to Zoom. While I presume Skype also has minimum system requirements, they should be lower than that of Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using google meet (which doesn’t even have any virtual background support at time of writing) or pretty much any other video calling platform, you could use the above method to set up a virtual greenscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could greatly customize your webcam footage. Maybe show a picture that says you are taking a toilet break instead of abruptly turning your camera off? Or even switch to different web cameras?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside is that OBS generally consumes a large amount of memory, so beware of performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;downloads&quot;&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/&quot;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download these two plugins: &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/&quot;&gt;OBS-VirtualCam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-ndi-newtek-ndi%E2%84%A2-integration-into-obs-studio.528/&quot;&gt;obs-ndi - NewTek NDI™ integration into OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep clicking next in their installations. You do not need to edit any parameters. Make sure you have downloaded everything before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPg5IfqAkAI&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Rest assured you have already installed all the prerequisites. However, there are some things you should note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of having someone else call you (as shown in the video), you could start a call with yourself. To do this, click meet now and start a meeting. This constitudes as an active call even though there’s only you in it. Make sure you turn on the video. Then, you should be able to see footage of your own camera in the NDI source.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change the OBS’s output to say a static picture. You create a new scene and add a picture to the source section. Whenever you want to show that picture, you switch to that scene. For more details, you could look at some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTk99mHDX_I&quot;&gt;OBS tutorials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;integration-with-zoom--google-meet&quot;&gt;Integration with Zoom / Google Meet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we need to stream whatever OBS is outputting to Zoom / Google Meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goto OBS, Click tools &amp;gt; VirtualCam &amp;gt; Start. Remember the Target Camera’s name&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goto Zoom, click settings &amp;gt; video &amp;gt; camera. Select the camera generated by VirtualCam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using Google Meet, click settings &amp;gt; video &amp;gt; camera. Select the camera generated by VirtualCam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trouble-shooting&quot;&gt;Trouble-shooting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cannot-find-skype-ndi-source-in-obs&quot;&gt;Cannot find skype NDI source in OBS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are in the skype call, check whether “Stop NDI” shows up on the upper left corner. If it doesn’t show up, it means you have not turned on NDI. You could turn on NDI in the middle of a call by going to settings &amp;gt; Calling &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Allow NDI usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If NDI is already turned on in your skype call and you still couldn’t find it. Turn NDI off and on again while you are in the call by going to settings. After you turn it back on, you should be able to select Skype as NDI source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lag-in-webcam-footage&quot;&gt;Lag in webcam footage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Force quite skype, then open skype and repeat the process again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Toby Lam</name><email>greenone092@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Motivation</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why start a website?</title><link href="https://www.tobylam.xyz/2020/08/11/why-start-a-website.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why start a website?" /><published>2020-08-11T01:45:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-08-11T01:45:00+08:00</updated><id>https://www.tobylam.xyz/2020/08/11/why-start-a-website</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.tobylam.xyz/2020/08/11/why-start-a-website.html">&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why I am starting this website / blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sustainabilty&quot;&gt;Sustainabilty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming increasingly unsustainable to manage my profile across all social media platforms, and I believe this will only get worse in the future. The popularity of social media also changes rapidly and should one lose out on popularity, I would inevitably have to switch to another one, essentially losing all of the past posts in the process. It’s also annoying for people to have to go through multiple social media pages just to be able to have a clearer understanding or my profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexibility&quot;&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it’s flexible. The content that I could put here is basically unlimited (except the 1Gb limit due to github pages’ restrictions). I could type &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mtext&gt;LaTeX&lt;/mtext&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;\LaTeX&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.89883em;vertical-align:-0.2155em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord textrm&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:-0.36em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.904999em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord textrm mtight sizing reset-size6 size3&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord textrm&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:-0.1667em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.46782999999999997em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.7845em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord textrm&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.2155em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:-0.125em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord textrm&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mathjax&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mathjax&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, make a long, organized and categorized series of tutorials and guides… This is just impossible to deliver using any other existing social media sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;portability&quot;&gt;Portability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should my web hosting fails or my domain changes, I still have a backup of the code / text that I have written. I could practically put it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decoupling-the-internet&quot;&gt;Decoupling the internet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the “internet” to a majority of the population is just an assortment of a few sites. Google, wikipedia, facebook, instagram, amazon etc, and I don’t think that this is what the internet should be. Everybody should have an individual presence on it. Most of these “big” sites also recommend content with a practically unknowable algorithm. By retreating to basic technologies such as RSS Feeds, you will be notified whenever there’s an update to a website you’re following, hence bypassing algorithms to a minor but certain degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-touch&quot;&gt;Final touch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website is open-source as it’s currently hosted by github pages. It’s free and has &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll&quot;&gt;quite a lot of documentation&lt;/a&gt;. If you just wanna make a simple, functional webpage like this, you could take a look at the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that while Wix / Squarespace / Wordpress are options for starting a webpage, I believe I’ll just be stuck in the same cycle but one level higher. To my knowledge, it’s basically impossible to transfer the website you made with these proprietary software to anywhere else. While github pages still have their limitations, I believe it’s still not a bad starter to hosting your first website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;custom-domains&quot;&gt;Custom Domains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve finally decided to buy a domain for this website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tobylam.xyz&quot;&gt;tobylam.xyz&lt;/a&gt;. I used Epik and it only costed me .99 USD per year and 8.5 USD per year for subsequent years. Fortunately, github pages could still &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site&quot;&gt;host the website for free&lt;/a&gt;, so the costs incurred by purchasing a domain is really quite minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering how much better &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tobylam.xyz&quot;&gt;tobylam.xyz&lt;/a&gt; sounds compared to greenone092.github.io, it’s definitely worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I used to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iangoodfellow.com/blog/jekyll/markdown/tex/2016/11/07/latex-in-markdown.html&quot;&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually ditched it for &lt;a href=&quot;https://katex.org&quot;&gt;KaTeX&lt;/a&gt; due to its increased speed. Refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xuningyang.com/2021-01-11-katex-with-jekyll/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for its use in jekyll. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:mathjax&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
