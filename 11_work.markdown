I have done some expository work over the years at a secondary school level, especially during my presidency at my school's mathematics society. Here are some of them and the challenges faced making them.

### Mathematics Journal

The Mathematics Journal was an collaborative project launched by the Mathematics Society that aims to write a short journal to be published during the Open Day. Here's the [PDF]({{ site.url }}/download/journal_snippet.pdf) to the snippets that I've written in the mathematics journal.

I mainly tried to introduce a part of HKDSE Physics's syllabus - Force and Motion with a greater degree of mathematical rigor and abstractness such that it could be more easily applied to 3 dimensions. I targeted readers who have had some experience in calculus but not linear algebra, as most people will usually be more familliar with the former. 

In retrospect, I think that I've skipped some important mathematical concepts, such as the line integral, which made the mathematical discussion quite unrigorous near the end. While most of the discussion is valid if viewed at a simpler one dimensional case, it kind of violated the original intention of generalizing existing concepts to 3 dimensions. 

### LaTeX Demonstration / Commented guide

Here's the [link](https://github.com/greenone092/Latex-Tutorial) to the github repository.

I've mainly written this at first to help myself remember the syntax involved in LaTeX. However it slowly became a demonstration of the basic features in LaTeX. My vision was for begineers to look through the generated pdfs, spot a feature that they would like to include in their own files, correspond it to the source code and then copy it. (along with any packages it used) 

I usually send this to someone whom I'm introducing LaTeX to. Perhaps with some simplicications, I believe this is quite a good way to show what LaTeX can do concisely and precisely.
