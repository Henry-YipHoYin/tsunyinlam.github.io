#### Motivatation

I personally find the expression of the fibonacci sequence using a matrix form to be the "easiest" or perhaps the most general way of solving linear difference equations (which the fibonacci sequence belongs to). As such I shall try to explain it as detailed as possible. 

#### Matrix Form

A 2-deimensional system of linear difference equations that descirbe the Fibonacci sequence is
