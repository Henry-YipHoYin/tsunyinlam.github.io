This would be the third in the series of blog posts detailing my learning in mathematics.

## Abstract Algebra

## Foundations of Coding Theory

After the summer of form 4, I realised I've spent way too little time on mathematics, and I thought that I needed to start attending courses provided by HKAGE. Foundations of Coding Theory, taught by Chan Kai Leung from CUHK, immediatdly caught my eye. It was the third course in a series of courses, the first and second course being about number theory and abstract algebra. I thought that if I could study abstract algebra leading up to the course, I would be able to attend this course.

The course was immensely fun. 

## Linear Algebra

I also joined a linear algebra course 


## Introduction to Cryptography

## Understanding Non-Euclidean Geometry

## Global Talent Mentoring Scheme
