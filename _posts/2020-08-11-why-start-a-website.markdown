There are a few reasons why I am starting this website / blog.

## Sustainabilty

It's becoming increasingly unsustianable to manage my profile across all social media platforms, and I believe this will only get worse in the future. The popularity of social media also changes rapidly and should one lose out on popularity, I would inevitably have to switch to another one, essentially losing all of the past posts in the process. It's also annoying for people to have to go through multiple social media pages just to be able to have a clearer understanding or my profile. 

## Flexibility

Secondly, it's flexible. The content that I could put here is basically unlimited (except the 1Gb limit due to github pages' restrictions). I could type $$\LaTeX$$ [^mathjax], make a long, organised and categorized series of tutorials and guides... This is just impossible to deliver using any other existing social media sites.

## Portability

Should my web hosting fails or my domain changes, I still have a backup of the code / text that I have written. I could pratically put it anywhere. 

## Decoupling the internet

Right now, the "internet" to a majority of the population is just an assortment of a few sites. Google, wikipedia, facebook, instagram, amazon etc, and I don't think that this is what the internet should be. Everybody should have an individual precense on it. Most of these "big" sites also recommend content with a pratically unknowable algorithm. By retreating to basic technolgoies such as RSS Feeds, you will be notified whenever there's an update to a website you're following, hence bypassing algorithms to a minor but certain degree.

## Final touch

This website is open-source as it's currently hosted by github pages. It's free and has [quite a lot of documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). If you just wanna make a simple, functional webpage like this, you could take a look at the code. 

I should also mention that while Wix / Squarespace / Wordpress are options for starting a webpage, I believe I'll just be stuck in the same cycle but one level higher. To my knowledge, it's basically impossible to transfer the website you made with these proprietary software to anywhere else. While github pages still have their limitations, I believe it's still not a bad starter to hosting your first website.

## Custom Domains 

Recently, I've finally decided to buy a domain for this website, [tobylam.xyz](http://www.tobylam.xyz). I used Epik and it only costed me .99 USD per year and 8.5 USD per year for subsequent years. Fortunately, github pages could still [host the website for free](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), so the costs incurred by purchasing a domain is really quite minimal. 

Considering how much better [tobylam.xyz](http://www.tobylam.xyz) sounds compared to greenone092.github.io, it's definetely worth considering.

[^mathjax]: Currently I'm using [MathJax](http://www.iangoodfellow.com/blog/jekyll/markdown/tex/2016/11/07/latex-in-markdown.html), it supports [a lot of symbols](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/v1.1-latest/tex.html#supported-latex-commands) by default already
