There are a few reasons why I am starting this website / blog.

First of all, it's becoming increasingly unsustianable to manage my profile across all social media platforms. The popularity of social media also changes rapidly and should one lose out on popularity, I would inevitably have to switch to another one. I would essentially lose all of the historical posts in the process. It's also annoying for people to have to go through multiple social media pages just to be able to have a clearer understanding or my profile. 

Secondly, it's flexible. The content that I could put here is basically unlimited (except the 1Gb limit due to github pages' restrictions). I could type LaTeX, make a long, organised and categorized series of tutorials and guides... This is just impossible to deliver using any other existing social media sites. I could also organise the content with much more flexibility.

Thirdly, it's portable. Currently, the website is made using jerkyll. Should my web hosting fails or my domain changes, I still have a backup of the code that's written. I could pratically port it everywhere and not worry about any external influences that may bring down this website. 

Finally, the internet should be decoupled. Right now, the "internet" to a majority of the population is just an assortment of a few sites. Google, wikipedia, facebook, instagram, amazon etc. I don't think that this is what the internet should be. Everybody should have an individual precense on it. 

As a final touch, this website is open-source as it's currently hosted by github. If you just wanna make a simple functional webpage, you could take a look at the code to get some ideas. There's obviously a bunch of other excellent resources out there for you to learn jerkyll and github pages, which for now seems to be a pretty good way to get your website hosted for free.
