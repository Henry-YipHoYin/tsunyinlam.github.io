I've recently recieved a conditional offer to read mathematics at Balliol College. There are a lot of things I wish I knew sooner and as such I'm gonna share it here. I'm gonna try to exclude some of the most talked over points. 

I'm also not going to talk much about my personal statement since there is no way to know whether my tutors actually liked it or not. My only advice would be to write a statement that you are satisified with! You should however ask for others' opinions. If their ideas persuade you, then you should change it. If not, don't! Ultimately, it's your application. 

## Mathematics Admission Test

#### Preparation

Doing all the [past papers](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Mathematics+Applitude+Test) is perhaps the best way to prepare. You should do some of them under timed conditions. You should also check out the [MAT livestream](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test/mat-livestream). If you really wanna do more exercise, do the [STEP foundation modules](https://maths.org/step/assignments). They are really fun. 

#### Use the previous subparts

All the subparts of the question should be logically connected. If you get stuck, try to use the results you got from the previous subparts. 

Even if you are sure something would work yet it doesn't use the previous subparts, you should still try to think of an alternative solution that uses them. It would usually be more elegant and less time-consuming.

#### Be thorough

Every keyword / condition that appears in the question should be mentioned / copied at least once on your answer. You should also  clearly state the results you've proved in the previous parts, and why they are applicable to your situation.

Doing so helps you realise whether you have used all of the information given, and lets the marker know that you are rigorously answering the question.

Some questions (Usually Q5) have a lot of cases to consider. You need to be very careful about them as there are often exceptional cases.

#### Intuition

While there are exceptions, most questions could usually be answered without much steps. If you find yourself painfully expanding terms, you are probably not noticing something you should've. This is especially important in graph questions. Usually you need to spot some rigid transfomration.

## Interviews

#### Preparation

Try to recite some of the common identities (calculus, trigonometry ...)  before the interview. It would be unfortunate if you had to waste valuable time deducing them on the spot 

#### Be thorough

Since you would be stressed out during the interview, it's very easy to commit careless mistakes (copying wrongly, arithemetic errors ...). Taking your time is better than reaching the wrong conclusion and having to backtrack. Be throughough and write down or speak out everything. 

#### Communicating with the tutors

Talk out loud. This is a very common advice and has to be stressed. 

Other than that, you should try and describe what your next steps are. This is especially true if you think you've figured out the solution. If you explain yourself, the tutors would not have to worry about whether you're on the right track while they are watching you work. 

This is especially important if you are unsure whether you're on the right track. If you explain yourself, they would usually say something to indicate whether you're on the right track. If they affirm your plan, then great! You don't have to worry about having the wrong approach when you're elaborating the solution. If they dispute it, then at least you didn't waste time further explaining it.

The tutors may also be more lenient on your careless mistakes since they know that you have the right thought in mind. If you didn't talk about your plans, they may think that you have had the entirely wrong idea from the first place.

#### Ask questions if necessary

Usually the tutors will ensure that you know the background and the context of the question. However if they throw out a word that they expect you to know yet you don't, it's perfectly fine to ask them about it. 

However, you should try to show them what you know or what you've been thinking first before asking. You would be able to show your thought process (which is ultimately what your tutors want to evaluate in the interview) and the tutors would be able to give you a better answer. 

#### Predict what they would ask you

Their first question they ask you might be very easy. While you are answering it, think about the complications they could throw at you. If they were asking about the $$n = 1$$ case, what about $$n = 2, 3 ...$$? Could you figure out a general solution? Don't rely on brute force methods. Usually they won't work for larger cases or the tutors would just ask you to generalize the solution.

#### What if the tutors say you're wrong?

Firstly, don't get defensive. Keep your cool.

Secondly, look out for any careless mistakes.

Thirdly, think about whether you have miscommunicated. Sometimes the tutors might have lost your train of thought. If you are certain that you are right, change the angle slightly (to show that you're not entirely stubborn) and explain yourself in detail again.

If they still imply that you are wrong, it's very important to be flexible. Don't be fixated at the method that you've been using. Listen to them carefully and give a meaningful response that reflects your understanding of what they've said.  Then recall what questions they've asked you. Simmilar to the MAT, all the subparts of the question are somewhat connected. Try to figure out the connection between them.

## As a final touch

Don't let university application get into your head too much! Ultimately, mathematics should be the thing that you pursue the most. Don't let your interest into mathematics die out or all would be pointless!
