#### Motivation

Kirchhoff's circuit laws beautifully expresses the circuit "laws" in HKDSE physics in a far more inuitive form. In combination of Ohm's Law, you could solve all circuitry questions in the DSE. 

#### Kirchhoff's current law 

The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero.



In other words, Current entering a node / component = Current exiting a node / component. This explains why in a series circuit, the current is the same for all of the components. You could also use this in start / end points of a parallel circuit to derive that the total current is the sum of the currents through the individual components

#### Kirchhoff's voltage law

The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop is zero.

This explains why in a series circuit, the voltage is the sum of the voltage drops of the individual components (resistance units). If we view the entire simple circuit as a closed loop, the e.m.f. generated by the battery must be cancelled by the potential differences of all of the load. 

It also explains why in a parallel circuit, the voltage is the same for all elements. This is because you could view the parallel circuit as a closed loop.
