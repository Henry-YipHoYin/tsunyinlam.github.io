title: My Mathematics Journey (Part 1)

As my public examinations have come to a close, I've decided to reflect upon my learning in mathematics. Inspired by my friend who has done something [simmilar](https://oscarmui.github.io/code.html), I've decided to write a series of blog posts detailing my learning in mathematics.

While I'm doing this mainly out of a desire to self-reflect, I hope that by reading the following, you would be able to know more about me.

## Rock Paper Scissors, Polynomials and the Pascal Triangle

Back when I was in primary school, I used to write random stuff about mathematics on sketchbooks. 

Particularly, I was obseesed with the identity $$AB=\bigg(\dfrac{A+B}{2}\bigg)\bigg(\dfrac{A-B}{2}\bigg)$$. For some reason, I thought that the identity was very cool and kept trying to think of applications to it to no avail. Over time, I kept wondering if it would pop up sometime in the future, and surprsingly it sort of did in a course I attended - "Introduction to Cryptography", which would be discussed later.

I was also interested in polynomials, I remember expanding sequences of $$(x+a)(x+b)$$, writing down $$(x+1)(x+1)=x^2+2x+1$$, $$(x+1)(x+2)=x^2+3x+2 \dots$$ only to suddenly realise what $$(x+a)(x+b)=x^2+(a+b)x+ab$$ meant, with the bittersweet feeling that I've wasted a lot of time.

I was also mesmerised by the Pascal Triangle. 

## Olympiad Mathematics

While I was in olympiad mathematics team and continued to participate til late secondary school, I was never very good at it. I suppose I didn't do enough exercises, and laterwards I felt increasingly frustrated by having to stick to a certain "syllabus" featured in olympiad competitions, and wanted to explore various fields on my own.
